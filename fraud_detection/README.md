# Fraud Detection Model Training

## Overview
This directory contains the necessary files and instructions for training the fraud detection model using machine learning techniques.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for building and training the machine learning model.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
    ```

2. Add these dependencies to your requirements.txt:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Collection
1.	Collect a large dataset of financial transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

2.	The dataset should be in CSV format and contain the following columns:
- transaction_id: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- amount: The amount of the transaction.
- category: The category of the transaction (e.g., income, expense, deposit).
- is_fraud: Binary indicator (1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 for legitimate transactions).

## Data Preparation
1. Load and preprocess the data using pandas. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training
1. Use scikit-learn to train a machine learning model on the prepared data.
2. Save the trained model using joblib for later use in the application.
